 Measure the temporal evolution of cebrafish videos

 # Experiment 1: Number of events in videos
 
 A cebrafish contracts, I want to measure the number of times it does and find patterns. Maybe parameters of the tail are to be measure too
	
	## Image Segmentation
	I use a macro that segments the fish using phantas. Several parameters are measured
	
	## Data Analysis
	Plot of Time series using orange
	
 # Experiment 2: Tracking of the fish in a well
 
 The fish moves freely. I measure the distance it goes dows using trackmate. To detect the fish, might be helpful to substract the edges of the well. To do so, substrac the median projection from the original video
 
 # Experiment 3: Movement of the tail
 
 Marta needs videos from a high speed acquisition camera
